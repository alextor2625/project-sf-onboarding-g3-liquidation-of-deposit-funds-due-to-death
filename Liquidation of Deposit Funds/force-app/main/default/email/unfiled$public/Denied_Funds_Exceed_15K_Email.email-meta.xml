    <textOnly>Hi {!Case.Contact}:

We understand that this is a challenging time for you, and we want to extend our sincerest condolences. Our team is committed to supporting you throughout this process. Upon reviewing your Liquidation Funds request under ticket {!Case.CaseNumber},  We regret to inform you  that we were unable to proceed because the disbursement amount is greater that $15,000 and you need to submit a Certificate of Release of Tax Lien.

Once you have it you can submit another request.

If you have any questions, you can contact us  at 787-724-3650 or visit one of our branches

We are here to serve you;
Banco Popular de Puerto Rico</textOnly>
